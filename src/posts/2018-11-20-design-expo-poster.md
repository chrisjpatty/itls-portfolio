This poster demonstrates several design principles. I've intentionally left a significant amount of whitespace, instead opting for a minimal design that focuses on the top strip, but leads the eye down to the event description in the bottom left corner. The diamonds draw from the colors of the image and are repeated between the top and bottom elements of the poster. The patterned dots add a contrasting visual element to the colorful ink texture, and were created as vector shape layers which were then carefully aligned and merged into single layers.
