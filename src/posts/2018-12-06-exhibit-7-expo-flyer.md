This is a unique design for an imagined design expo. The shapes that make up the design seem random at first glance, but are actually only made up of simple squares, triangles, and circles. This consistency harmonizes the design. The colors are also repeated throughout the various shapes to pull the design together. The right side of the image where the text resides, is intentionally minimalistic, and draws the eye down the length of the image towards the title.
