This poster represents several design principles, like repetition, harmony, and color schemes. The icons are repeated around the text and their weights and colors are harmonized to match. The center text and icons use overlay blending modes to blend their colors into the background, and the remainder of the text is left white to stick out from the rest of the design and provide visual emphasis.
