Exhibit 1 is a unique take on the educational poster theme. The composition is inspired by similarly juxtaposed photos made popular on platforms like Instagram. Using the HSL curves the orange tones were accentuated, and all other colors were blue-shifted and desaturated to help unify the two photos. The text is taken from the popular 90’s children’s show, “Magic School Bus”. Further, I chose to add a shadow to the font so that the orange color of the photos could be pulled into the text.
