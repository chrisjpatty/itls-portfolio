This business card demonstrates various design principles including form, color schemes, white-space, and typography. This card omits typical contact information in favor of links to my Dribbble and Twitter accounts. Of special note, the front of the card is left intentionally information-less and instead has only a geometric pattern. On the back of the card, the shapes and colors from the front are repeated at the top of the card. This works to unify the designs between the two sides.
