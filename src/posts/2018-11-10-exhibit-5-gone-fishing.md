This piece is a take on the classic "Ship in a bottle", although I opted for a spherical container in this example. This piece demonstrates advanced image manipulation techniques such as masking, compositing, color-matching, and perspective-warping. The ocean is a combination of about 6 different water photos and textures whose color and perspective were matched using curves, masking, and hand painting. The sphere itself was hand painted to draw together and unify the piece.
